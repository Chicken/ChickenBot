            <p>
                Antti.Codes provides a Discord chat bot (the "Bot"), and a website (the "Site") and
                related services (collectively, the "Service(s)"). The Service is operated by
                Antti.Codes. (the "Company", "we" or "us") for users of the Service ("you"). This
                Privacy Policy sets forth our policy with respect to information that is collected
                from visitors to the Site and users of the bot and/or the Services. Under applicable
                law, Antti.Codes is the “data controller” of personal data collected through the
                Services.
            </p>
            <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
            <p>
                When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect information from you,
                as further described below: <br />

                <strong>Information You Provide</strong>: We collect information from you when you
                voluntarily provide such information, such as when you use any of the Services.
                Information we collect may include but not be limited to usage data, usernames, or
                other content you send to us by interacting with the Bot.
            </p>
            <h3>OTHER INFORMATION</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data We Collect Automatically</strong>: When you interact with us
                    through the Services, we receive and store certain information such as an IP
                    address, device ID, and your activities within the Services. We may store such
                    information or such information may be included in databases owned and
                    maintained by affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such
                    information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total
                    number of visitors to our Site, as well as the sites which refer visitors to the
                    Services.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cookies</strong>: We employ cookies and similar technologies to keep
                    track of your local computer’s settings such as which account you have logged
                    into. Cookies are pieces of data that sites and services can set on your browser
                    or device that can be read on future visits. We may expand our use of cookies to
                    save additional data as new features are added to the Service.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>WHERE INFORMATION IS PROCESSED</h2>
            <p>
                The Company is based in Finland and the Services are hosted in Germany (by Contabo
                GmbH). No matter where you are located, you consent to the processing and
                transferring of your information in and to Finland, Germany and other countries. The
                laws of Finland, Germany and other countries governing data collection and use may
                not be as comprehensive or protective as the laws of the country where you live.
            </p>
            <h2>OUR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>
                We use the information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy
                Policy. If you provide information for a certain reason, we may use the information
                in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you
                contact us by email, we will use the information you provide to answer your question
                or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide information in order to obtain access
                to the Services, we will use your information to provide you with access to such
                services and to monitor your use of such services. The Company and its subsidiaries
                and affiliates (the "Related Companies") may also use your information collected
                through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the
                Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Services.
            </p>
            <h2>OUR LEGAL BASES FOR HANDLING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
            <p>
                The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground
                they rely on to use or disclose your personal data. To the extent those laws apply,
                our legal grounds are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.</li>
                <li>
                    Provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User
                    and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the
                    Owner is subject.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in
                    the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by
                    the Owner or by a third party.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that
                applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data
                is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into
                a contract.
            </p>
            <h2>OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>
                The Company is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this
                information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however,
                certain circumstances in which we may share your information with certain third
                parties, as set forth below:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Consent</strong>: We may transfer your information with your consent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Consultants and outside collaborators</strong>: Like many businesses, we
                    sometimes request the help of other companies or individuals to perform certain
                    functions. Examples of such functions include accessing, modifying and adding to
                    the open-source source code. In order to perform these functions they may
                    require samples of any of the data stored by the Services. These people will
                    however never have access to the full data and any data will always be
                    anonymized where required.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: We may disclose your information if
                    required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is
                    necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the
                    rights or property of the Company or Related Companies, (iii) protect the
                    personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against
                    legal liability.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>UNSOLICITED INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>
                You may provide us with ideas for new products or modifications to existing
                products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, "Unsolicited
                Information"). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential
                and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited
                Information to others without limitation or attribution.
            </p>
            <h2>CHILDREN</h2>
            <p>
                Our Services are for users age 13 and over and we do not knowingly collect personal
                information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian of a
                child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed personal information
                to us please contact us at <a href="mailto:antti@antti.codes">antti@antti.codes</a>.
                Note: In some countries, the age of digital consent is older than 13. If you are in
                those countries, you must be at least that age to use the Services. For example, for
                residents of the EEA, where processing of personal information is based on consent,
                Antti.Codes will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of
                consent established by applicable data protection law. If we learn that we are
                engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such processing and will
                take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable information from our records.
            </p>
            <h2>LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES</h2>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to
                other web sites not operated or controlled by us (the "Third Party Sites"). The
                policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The
                links from the Services do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed the Third
                Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their
                privacy policies.
            </p>
            <h2>DATA RETENTION</h2>
            <p>
                We generally retain personal data for so long as it may be relevant to the purposes
                identified herein. To dispose of personal data, we may anonymize it, delete it or
                take other appropriate steps. Data may persist in copies made for backup and
                business continuity purposes for additional time.
            </p>
            <h2>SECURITY</h2>
            <p>
                We take reasonable steps to protect the information provided via the Services from
                loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
                However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In
                particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure. Therefore, you
                should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email.
                Please keep this in mind when disclosing any information via the Internet.
            </p>
            <h2>YOUR DATA RIGHTS AND CHOICES</h2>
            <p>
                We believe that users should be treated equally no matter where they are, and so we
                are making the following options to control your data available to all users,
                regardless of their location.
                <br />
                Individuals in California, the European Economic Area, Canada, Costa Rica and some
                other jurisdictions outside the United States have certain legal rights to obtain
                confirmation of whether we hold personal data about them, to access personal data we
                hold about them (including, in some cases, in portable form), and to obtain its
                correction, update, amendment or deletion in appropriate circumstances. They may
                also object to our uses or disclosures of personal data, to request a restriction on
                its processing, or withdraw any consent, though such actions typically will not have
                retroactive effect. They also will not affect our ability to continue processing
                data in lawful ways.

                Data Request" in the subject or body of your message, along with an explanation of
                what data subject right you are seeking to exercise. For your protection, we may
                take steps to verify identity before responding to your request. In addition we
                provide you with a bot functionality to easily delete data we have on you.

                We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from
                time to time without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and
                especially before you provide any information. This Privacy Policy was last updated
                on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Services after any changes or
                revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of
